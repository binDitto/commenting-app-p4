<!--  This form_for is passing in two things
 current post, and adding votes to this post
 post is identifying the post you want to add votes to
 post.votes.build is adding the votes to that post
 before I had Vote.new which is adding a new vote in general
 but since the first argument is for post, it understands the relation anyways. -->
<%= form_for([upvote,  Vote.new ]) do |p| %>
  <%= p.hidden_field :vote, value: 1 %>
  <%= button_tag(class: "btn btn-default btn-sm btn-top") do %>
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-up fa-lg"></i>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
<!-- end upvote form -->
